          The Idea Of Studying In Russia
        </h1>
        <p className="text-neutral9 text-sm font-normal">
          Sprawling across two continents and spanning an incredible nine time
          zones (having cut down from 11 in 2010), Russia is the largest country
          in the world by far. Within its vast boundaries lie some of the
          planet’s most luxurious palaces, extensive plateaus, highest
          mountains, coldest cities, strongest spirits, best ballet companies,
          and largest collections of stacking dolls. In terms of culture,
          literature is one of the country’s most notable displays; Russian
          authors such as Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Dostoyevsky and Nabokov are
          celebrated worldwide for creating some of the greatest works of the
          19th and 20th centuries. Russian StudentsOne of the fast-growing
          economies in the world, alongside the other BRICS countries, Russia is
          keen to internationalize its higher education system, and is investing
          in developing its universities and extending support for international
          applicants.

          Education In Russia
        </h1>
        <p className="text-neutral9 text-sm font-normal">
          There are three basic kinds of higher education institutions in
          Russia. These are Universities, Academies and Institutes. Universities
          offer a wide spectrum of programs on all levels of education.
          Academies povide higher education at all levels and conduct a large
          amount of research – usually specialised in one branch such as
          science, art or architecture. Institutes are independent parts of
          universities or academies offering professional education programs.
          Education in RussiaRussia has more university graduates than any other
          country in Europe. This is largely due to the government financing all
          education and higher education including living expenses during the
          Soviet era. There are some 519 institutions of higher education and 48
          universities in Russia. Russia has historically placed much emphasis
          on science and technology in educations, and most of the government
          run institutions are specialized within this area. This is also where
          Russian higher education has its best reputation. To complement these
          traditional Russian institutions, many private institutions of higher
          educations have been emerging, often providing education in those
          areas not traditionally in focus such as economics, business and law.
          Russia is currently in the process of switching its traditional higher
          education degree model to one that is much more compatible with
          Western-type academic degrees. In 2003, Russia signed the Bologna
          Declaration which paved the way for the government to enact a law that
          removed its old, five-year degree model to one that resembles the U.S.
          degree system–the four-year bachelor degree followed by a master’s
          degree. However, the postdoctorate degree still retains the
          traditional, Soviet Union pattern that was established nearly 90 years
          ago. Basically, PhDs in Russia are defined and earned according to the
          depth of a student’s personal achievements in scientific research
          (doktor nauk, or doctor of science) or academic research.

          Cultural Diversity
        </h1>
        <p className="text-neutral9 text-sm font-normal">
          The population of Russia is made up of over 160 different ethnic
          groups speaking more than 100 different languages. The official
          language of the country is Russia, which the majority of the
          population speaks, but other popular languages include Tatar and
          Ukrainian. Students wondering why study in Russia are drawn to the
          culturally rich environment created by the incredibly diverse
          population of Russia.Russia possesses one of the best mass-education
          systems in the world, and has a long-standing tradition of
          high-quality education for all citizens. Russia’s education system
          produces a 98% literacy rate, exceeding that of most Western European
          countries. Russia’s top universities are located in Moscow and St.
          Petersburg, with Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg being
          the most well-known. The top universities in Russia have extremely
          competitive entry requirements, and hold special entry exams each
          year.
