          We are in the sphere of preparing the future leaders of tomorrow by
          offering a chance to study abroad today. By enrolling in Russian
          universities and classes you can ensure that you are ready to meet the
          challenges that lie ahead in a world filled by international commerce.
          Many times, the years spent in college do not prepare an individual
          for a career in the workforce. By moving past your comfort zone, you
          can show potential employers that you have what it takes to become a
          future leader. Prepare yourself for the career you have dreamed of by
          attending a Russian school that will prepare you for a future in
          medicine, business, economics and more. Don’t fall victim to the old
          school system by lagging behind in important subject areas. Prepare
          yourself, and your future by investing in the classes that you will
          need in order to enter the business world. Set yourself apart from
          your competition and take advantage of a chance that may never come
          your way again. We will help you to discover the university that is
          right for you, and guide you through the process of applying for a
          Russian education. Let a group of professionals take you through the
          steps needed to help you get into the university of your dreams.

          For Parents
        </h1>
        <p className="text-neutral9 text-sm font-normal">
          We know what an important step is the decision to send your child to
          get higher education overseas. It seems that your child will never get
          used to a different cultural environment, climatic conditions,
          language, food, people… However, think about prestigious profession
          and Russian degree of state university which is internationally
          recognized, and temporary challenges such as the cultural adaptation
          in new country will easily turn into exciting advantages. At the end
          of the day this is what you have always dreamed about and for what
          your child aspired conquering the most complex sciences in school.We
          will also provide here the information which could be useful and
          interesting for the parents of our students… We recommend you to let
          your child make his/her own decision on the choice of the future
          profession and university where he/she wants to study. It will assure
          high motivation and responsibility for the success in studies. Check,
          however, that the choice of the profession is based on intellectual
          passion, not immediate emotion. The future profession should be chosen
          taking into consideration requirements of employment market, as well
          as prospects of economic development of your country in the coming
          years. Do not forget, however, about child’s personal abilities and
          preferences. From our experience, the students who have successfully
          finished the school, do not always succeed in their studies at
          university, if the choice of specialty was made by their parents and
          not by themselves. At the same time very often the students who
          studied in school at medium level, are very successful at the
          University as they are motivated in mastering the course they like and
          passionate about acquiring their future profession.
